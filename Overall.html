  <p align="center"><font size=5>The Course BTT1O1 also Shows many of the Catholic Graduate Expectations. Let me Show you Two that the Couse has Taught me the Most About.
    The First one is being a A SELF-DIRECTED, RESPONSIBLE, LIFE LONG LEARNER. I Learned how to Be Responsible with the Help of Time Management Skills and I Learned to Never Give
    up Through many Moments of Worry and Stress. The Second Expectation is Being  A COLLABORATIVE CONTRIBUTOR. I Learned to be Collaborative Through many Group Projects. 
    Every Project was Different and I Learned to Adapt from Different Group Environments.</font></p>
